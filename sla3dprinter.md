# SLA 3d Printer

# What is SLA
tereolithography (SLA) is an additive manufacturing process that belongs to the Vat Photopolymerization family. In SLA, an object is created by selectively curing a polymer resin layer-by-layer using an ultraviolet (UV) laser beam. The materials used in SLA are photosensitive thermoset polymers that come in a liquid form.

SLA is famous for being the first 3D Printing technology: its inventor patented the technology back in 1986. If parts of very high accuracy or smooth surface finish are needed, SLA is the most cost-effective 3D printing technology available. Best results are achieved when the designer takes advantage of the benefits and limitations of the manufacturing process.

SLA has many common characteristics with Direct Light Processing (DLP), another Vat Photopolymerization 3D printing technology. For simplicity, the two technologies can be treated as equals.
# How does SLA work?

Here is how the SLA fabrication process works:

    The build platform is first positioned in the tank of liquid photopolymer, at a distance of one layer height for the surface of the liquid.

    Then a UV laser creates the next layer by selectively curing and solidifying the photopolymer resin. The laser beam is focused in the predetermined path using a set of mirrors, called galvos. The whole cross sectional area of the model is scanned, so the produced part is fully solid.

    When a layer is finished, the platform moves at a safe distance and the sweeper blade re-coats the surface. The process then repeats until the part is complete.

    After printing, the part is in a green, no-fully-cured state and requires further post processing under UV light if very high mechanical and thermal properties are required.

Photo means 'light' and polymers are formed by amalgamation of many molecules (monomers). A photopolymer is a type of polymer that changes its physical properties when it is exposed to light. Photopolymers are very popular and popular build material used by 3D printers. The liquid resin is solidified through a process called photopolymerization: during solidification, the monomer carbon chains that compose the liquid resin are activated by the light of the UV laser and become solid, creating strong unbreakable bonds between each other. The photopolymerization process is irreversible and there is no way to convert the SLA parts back to their liquid form: when heated, they will burn instead of melting. This is because the materials that are produced with SLA are made of thermoset polymers, as opposed to the thermoplastics that FDM uses.
# Cleaning
Once the print process is completed, the build platform can be removed from the printer. The printed object then require rinsing in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to remove any uncured resin from their surface as shown in image.dont forget to wear saftey gloves.

# Curing

After cleaning the 3d object is cured in the ultravoilet light in the instrument for 30 min and then it is taken out.The cleaning and curing devices are shown below:-
