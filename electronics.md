# Introduction to KiCad

KiCad is an open-source software tool for the creation of electronic schematic diagrams and PCB artwork. Beneath its singular surface, KiCad incorporates an elegant ensemble of the following stand-alone software tools:
# KiCad Workflow

Despite its similarities with other PCB design software, KiCad is characterised by a unique workflow in which schematic components and footprints are separate. Only after creating a schematic are footprints assigned to the components.
# Overview

The KiCad workflow is comprised of two main tasks: drawing the schematic and laying out the board. Both a schematic component library and a PCB footprint library are necessary for these two tasks. KiCad includes many components and footprints, and also has the tools to create new ones.

In the picture below, you see a flowchart representing the KiCad workflow. The flowchart explains which steps you need to take, and in which order. When applicable, the icon is added for convenience.
# Draw electronic schematics

In this section we are going to learn how to draw an electronic schematic using KiCad.
Using Eeschema:-

    Under Windows run kicad.exe. Under Linux type 'kicad' in your Terminal. You are now in the main window of the KiCad project manager. From here you have access to eight stand-alone software tools: Eeschema, Schematic Library Editor, Pcbnew, PCB Footprint Editor, GerbView, Bitmap2Component, PCB Calculator and Pl Editor. Refer to the work-flow chart to give you an idea how the main tools are used.
